# Website-Project

Files: (css, js, and html)

Each file extension had their own folder but since I can't upload them in the same format anymore, they might seem scattered and
out of the place so I'm truly sorry for that.

As of the moment, the web hosting site I have put it on is down so it is unavailable at the moment. 
I shall post the link here once it is back up again. As for the sources, I have forgotten where I have gotten some of the assets since
this was something I did awhile back but I'll do my best to give due credit to the original creators.
